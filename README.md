# Ultimate Lineup Picker

Ultimate Lineup Picker is a tool that uses Sportsbook player props to determine the ideal fantasy football lineup. By analyzing how Vegas believes players will perform, ULP can infer fantasy points scored. When given a team of players, ULP will use these inferences to generate the ideal lineup for the upcoming week of play.
